[Ruse][ruse-lang] is an embedded Scheme for Rust, like Lua is for C. It is currently in development, and can be [found on GitHub][ruse].

Ruse is a [stress-free project][stress-free], and exists for fun, experimentation, and education. If you're interested in seeing how Scheme can be implemented, and in learning with other contributors about how to make a real programming language, this is the project for you.

If you're looking for a real-world-ready programming language to solve some immediate problem, best look elsewhere.

The Ruse team maintains a list of other programming languages implemented in Rust, which you [may be interested in perusing][langs-in-rust].

The code for this website is [also on GitHub][website], if you want to suggest changes.
